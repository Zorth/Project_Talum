# Project Talum
Open Source VR, asymmetrical video game based on Unity in C#

Hey! welcome to the Project Talum github page.
I'm currently working hard on this game and any help is welcome feel free to modify this game in an effort to make it as good as possible.
If you have any questions feel free to contact me on discord: @Zorth#2178

I currently have a demo not including all of the current features but stable.
